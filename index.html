              <li> If the recipient does not have an M-PESA account, Safaricom M-PESA will send the recipient an SMS containing a one-time voucher to enable them to cash the value sent to them.</li>
              <li> If within 7 days (or such shorter or longer period as may be determined by Safaricom M-PESA) of the Transaction being made to a non-registered recipient, the recipient has not opened or cashed their voucher, Safaricom M-PESA will cancel the Transaction and the E-Money will be sent back to your Account. You will be notified by SMS of the cancellation and reversion of the E-Money.</li>
              <li> A Transaction once completed is final and irrevocable. As such, Safaricom M-PESA shall not be under any compulsion to reverse any Transaction.</li>
              <li> Notwithstanding clause 8.13, Safaricom M-PESA reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to cancel or reverse a Transaction if reasonable grounds such as manifest error or fraud, or duress or criminal force are shown and PROVIDED that the recipient has not redeemed the E-Money and the reversal claim is made within one (1) month of the erroneous Transaction date.</li>
              <li> Without prejudice to clause 8.14, Safaricom M-PESA will not be compelled to refund or compensate you as a sender if the E-Money is sent to a recipient mistakenly or in error or fraudulently or under duress and subsequently redeemed for Cash or otherwise spent by the recipient of the mistaken, erroneous, or fraudulent Transaction and you hereby agree to hold Safaricom M-PESA harmless from any losses arising from a mistaken, erroneous or fraudulent transfer of funds or any transfer of funds from your Account effected under duress or under coercion or criminal force.</li>
